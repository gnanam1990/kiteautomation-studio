# Stage 02 — Backend API for KiteAutomation Studio

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Build the Hono API surface for **KiteAutomation Studio** using the schema from Stage 01.

## Required API endpoints
Implement these endpoints or their direct REST equivalent:

- `GET /workflows`
- `POST /workflows`
- `GET /workflows/:id`
- `POST /workflows/:id/test`
- `POST /runs/:id/replay`
- `GET /runs`
- `POST /approvals/:id/approve`
- `POST /approvals/:id/deny`
- `POST /webhooks/:triggerId`


## API architecture
Create:

```txt
packages/api/src/index.ts
packages/api/src/app.ts
packages/api/src/routes/
packages/api/src/middleware/error-handler.ts
packages/api/src/middleware/request-id.ts
packages/api/src/middleware/auth-placeholder.ts
packages/api/src/services/
packages/api/src/repositories/
```

## Requirements
- Every route validates input with Zod.
- Every route returns typed JSON.
- Errors use consistent shape:

```ts
{
  ok: false,
  error: { code: string; message: string; details?: unknown },
  request_id: string
}
```

- Success responses use:

```ts
{ ok: true, data: unknown, request_id: string }
```

- Add pagination to list endpoints using `limit`, `cursor`, or `page`.
- Add filters for status/date/address where useful.
- Add basic local auth placeholder based on `x-demo-owner-address` header, but keep it clearly marked as demo-only.
- Do not implement insecure production auth in this stage.

## Product-specific behavior
The API must support the major modules:

1. **Trigger Engine** — Detect on-chain and off-chain events and start workflow runs.
2. **Condition Builder** — Visual rule engine for deciding whether a workflow continues.
3. **Agent Decision Step** — Optional LLM decision step that classifies events and proposes actions.
4. **Action Executor** — Executes safe actions and queues risky/fund-moving actions for approval.
5. **Audit Log + Replay** — Inspectable history of every workflow run and replay support.

## OpenAPI/docs
- Add a generated or hand-written `packages/api/API.md`.
- Include request/response examples.
- Include curl examples for the core happy paths.

## Acceptance criteria
- API starts locally.
- Health endpoint works.
- CRUD/list/detail endpoints work for seeded data.
- Invalid payloads return 400 with useful messages.
- Demo auth is clearly marked as not production auth.

## Required verification

Run these commands and fix all issues before ending the stage:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint || true
pnpm -r test || true
grep -rn "Instrument\|font-instrument\|font-serif" packages/web/src packages/web/index.html || true
grep -rn "violet\|indigo\|cyan\|#7C3AED\|#4F46E5\|#06B6D4" packages/web/src || true
```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.
